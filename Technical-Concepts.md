## Docker

Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. It uses a YAML file to configure your application's services, networks, and volumes, which makes the process of managing and deploying multi-container applications easier and more efficient. Here's a basic overview of how to use Docker Compose, along with an example:

Basic Concepts of Docker Compose:
Services: These are your application containers. Each service can be based on an image from Docker Hub or use an image built from a Dockerfile.

Networks: Docker Compose sets up a single network for your application by default. Each container for a service joins the default network and is both reachable by other containers on that network and discoverable by them.

Volumes: These are used to persist data generated by and used by Docker containers.
